            <Summary>The Others, known as the "White Walkers" among the wildlings, exist north of the Wall.
Before the events in the Novel, the Others had supposedly not been seen for many thousand years.
So far the Others have appeared in the flesh only twice in the whole saga and their purpose remains unknown at this time.

		<Summary>
		Jon Snow is the bastard son of Eddard Stark, by a mother whose identity is a source of speculation.
He was raised by his father alongside his true-born half-siblings, but joins the Night's Watch when he nears adulthood. He is constantly accompanied by his albino direwolf Ghost.

		<Summary>The Night's Watch has built nineteen castles along the hundred leagues of the Wall. At the zenith of it's power, the Watch had seventeen of the castles manned, with over ten thousand men-at-arms between them. Castle Black alone quartered five thousand fighting men with all their horses, servants, and equipment. The highborn of the North have traditionally considered it an honor to serve on the Wall. Many younger sons of Northern houses, low in the line of succession, gladly took the black. 300 years after Aegon's conquest, only three castles remain in use and the Night's Watch's numbers have dwindled to fewer than a thousand men. Not only that, but the Night's Watch is now largely made up of the misfits of the Seven Kingdoms: peasants, debtors, poachers, rapers, thieves, and bastards. Only a few of the noble and knightly houses south of The Neck have members in the Night's Watch, and most serve because they fought on the wrong side of a war or fell afoul of political machinations.
